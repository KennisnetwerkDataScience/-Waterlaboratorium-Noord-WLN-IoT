WLN data analysis, team1, Nov-2018

## Preliminaries
* Use Jupyter Lab (preferred) or Jupyter Notebooks.
* Ensure these packages are available:
    * `pandas`
    * `altair` - Works out of the box with Jupyter Lab, for Notebooks you need some config, see Google. 
* Extract data.zip, it contains exports of Excel sheets for easier reading. It has the same password as the Excel file. Take care not to upload the unprotected files to github! 

## Tricks
* Use library `pickle` to write objects to disk and restore them.
* Share kernels between notebooks to access the same variables. 
    
## Files
See individual notebooks for more details.
